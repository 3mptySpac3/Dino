Hello! This is a Dino game I created using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The key feature of this game is the collision recognition between two objects, which adds an exciting challenge.

## How to Use the Application

To enjoy the game, here are some tips:

- **Jump**: Press the `Spacebar` to make the Dino jump over obstacles.
- **Restart Game**: Press `R` to restart the game at any time.
- **Music**: Press `F` to play some background music. `Good Luck`

Enjoy the game and try to beat my high score!

## Features

- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Collision detection to test your reflexes.
